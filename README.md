## Laravel-test
Practice basic Laravel usage 

Hello, I'm a newbie Lavavel. This will be my practice.
It may not look good, but it will be my basic practice. For my future work

(Plus, I will practice using GitHub to get used to it.)

Okay. What I will practice from the channel: KongRuksiam Tutorial
His channel: https://www.youtube.com/@KongRuksiamTutorial

After I really finish practicing, I will start doing my own projects.

Thank you very much  :3  (You can give me advice.)
